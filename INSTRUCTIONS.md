# Fixing Deprecation Warnings in Your Project

Hello Adil,

I noticed several deprecation warnings in your build log. These are happening because the `eslint` package in your project is outdated.

To fix this, I've updated your `package.json` to use the latest version of ESLint. Please follow these steps in your local command line to apply the changes and clean up your project:

```bash
# Step 1: Remove the old node_modules directory
rm -rf node_modules

# Step 2: Remove the old package-lock.json file
rm package-lock.json

# Step 3: Reinstall dependencies with the updated packages
npm install
```

This process ensures that all old, transitive dependencies are removed and a fresh, correct set of packages are installed. It is a more reliable solution than running `npm audit fix --force`, which can sometimes lead to an inconsistent state.
