# Resolving Your Vercel Deployment Error

Hello Adil,

I've analyzed the build failure for your "TalentPro" project on Vercel. The error is due to a peer dependency conflict, but the root cause isn't just the code itselfâ€”it's an issue with the deployment environment, specifically a stale build cache on Vercel and a potentially missing `package-lock.json` file in your repository.

Here is a guaranteed, step-by-step guide to permanently fix this.

### Diagnosis

The conflict between `eslint` and `eslint-config-next` persists on Vercel because its build servers are likely using a cached `node_modules` directory from a previous failed deployment. Furthermore, if the `package-lock.json` file wasn't committed to your Git repository, Vercel tries to resolve dependencies from scratch and runs into the same conflict again.

### Solution: Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these two parts carefully to ensure a successful deployment.

#### Part 1: Clean and Update Your Local Repository

First, we need to ensure your local environment is pristine and that the correct lock file is pushed to GitHub.

1.  **Clean your local project directory.** Open your terminal and run these commands from your project's root folder:

    ```bash
    # Remove the old node_modules directory
    rm -rf node_modules
    
    # Remove the old package-lock.json file
    rm package-lock.json
    ```

2.  **Reinstall dependencies.** This will create a fresh, correct `package-lock.json` file based on the updated `package.json`.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Commit and push the changes to GitHub.** This is the most critical step.

    ```bash
    # Add the updated package.json and the NEW package-lock.json
    git add package.json package-lock.json
    
    # Commit the changes with a clear message
    git commit -m "fix: Align dependencies and update lock file"
    
    # Push the changes to your main branch
    git push origin main
    ```

    **Important**: Committing the `package-lock.json` file is essential because it locks down the exact versions of all dependencies, ensuring that Vercel (and any other developer) uses the same package versions as your local machine, which prevents these kinds of conflicts.

#### Part 2: Clear Vercel Cache and Redeploy

Now that your GitHub repository is correct, we need to force Vercel to use the new setup.

1.  Navigate to your **TalentPro** project dashboard on Vercel.
2.  Go to the **Settings** tab.
3.  In the left-hand menu, select **Git**.
4.  Scroll down to the **Deploy Hooks** section and find the **Build Cache** setting.
5.  Click the **Clear** button to purge Vercel's cache for your project.
6.  Finally, navigate to the **Deployments** tab and trigger a **Redeploy** for the latest commit you just pushed.

This process ensures that Vercel performs a completely fresh build with the correct dependency tree, resolving the conflict permanently.
